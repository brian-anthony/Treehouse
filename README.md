# Save Treehouse videos from the terminal

This is a handy little script written in python to save videos from Treehouse where I learned about Git and Github.  An account is required to access the Treehouse website.  Any potential users will need to know how to retrieve cookies and either add into the file or paste into the command line when asked.

## Requirements

python

*libraries used*:
requests,
lxml,
os

    Run the script from the directory "/root/":

    $ cd /root/ && python scraping.py
